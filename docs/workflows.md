# Workflows

Workflow encapsulates the orchestration of activities and child workflows.
It can also answer to synchronous queries and receive external events (also known as signals).

## Workflow Interface

A workflow must define an interface class. All of its methods must have one of the following annotations:
- @WorkflowMethod indicates an entry point to a workflow. It contains parameters such as timeouts and a task list. Required
parameters (like executionStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds) that are not specified through the annotation must be provided at runtime.
- @Signal indicates a method that reacts to external signals. It must have a `void` return type.
- @Query indicates a method that reacts to synchronous query requests.
You can have more than one method with the same annotation.
```java
public interface FileProcessingWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod(executionStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds = 10, taskList = "file-processing")
    String processFile(Arguments args);

    @QueryMethod(name="history")
    List<String> getHistory();

    @QueryMethod(name="status")
    String getStatus();

    @SignalMethod
    void retryNow();
}
```
## Starting workflow executions

Given a workflow interface executing a workflow requires initializing a `WorkflowClient` instance, creating
a client side stub to the workflow, and then calling a method annotated with @WorkflowMethod.
```java
WorkflowClient workflowClient = WorkflowClient.newClient(cadenceServiceHost, cadenceServicePort, domain);
// Create a workflow stub.
FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class);
```
There are two ways to start workflow execution: synchronously and asynchronously. Synchronous invocation starts a workflow
and then waits for its completion. If the process that started the workflow crashes or stops the waiting, the workflow continues executing.
Because workflows are potentially long running, and crashes of clients happen, it is not very commonly found in production use.
Asynchronous start initiates workflow execution and immediately returns to the caller. This is the most common way to start
workflows in production code.

Synchronous start:
```java
// Start a workflow and the wait for a result.
// Note that if the waiting process is killed, the workflow will continue execution.
String result = workflow.processFile(workflowArgs);
```
Asynchronous:
```java
// Returns as soon as the workflow starts.
WorkflowExecution workflowExecution = WorkflowClient.asyncStart(workflow::processFile, workflowArgs);

System.out.println("Started process file workflow with workflowId=\"" + workflowExecution.getWorkflowId()
                    + "\" and runId=\"" + workflowExecution.getRunId() + "\"");
```
If you need to wait for a workflow completion after an asynchronous start, the simplest way
is to call the blocking version again. If `WorkflowOptions.WorkflowIdReusePolicy` is not `AllowDuplicate` then instead
of throwing `DuplicateWorkflowException`, it reconnects to an existing workflow and waits for its completion.
The following example shows how to do this from a different process than the one that started the workflow. All this process
needs is a `WorkflowID`.
```java
WorkflowExecution execution = new WorkflowExecution().setWorkflowId(workflowId);
FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(execution);
// Returns result potentially waiting for workflow to complete.
String result = workflow.processFile(workflowArgs);
```
## Implementing Workflows

A workflow implementation implements a workflow interface. Each time a new workflow execution is started,
a new instance of the workflow implementation object is created. Then, one of the methods
(depending on which workflow type has been started) annotated with @WorkflowMethod is invoked. As soon as this method
returns the workflow, execution is closed. While workflow execution is open, it can receive calls to signal and query methods.
No additional calls to workflow methods are allowed. The workflow object is stateful, so query and signal methods
can communicate with the other parts of the workflow through workflow object fields.

### Calling Activities

`Workflow.newActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an activity interface.
It takes activity type and activity options as arguments. Activity options are needed only if some of the required
timeouts are not specified through the @ActivityMethod annotation.

Calling a method on this interface invokes an activity that implements this method.
An activity invocation synchronously blocks until the activity completes, fails, or times out. Even if activity
execution takes a few months, the workflow code still sees it as a single synchronous invocation.
Isn't it great? I doesn't matter what happens to the processes that host the workflow. The business logic code
just sees a single method call.
```java
public class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {

    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;

    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
        this.store = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class);
    }

    @Override
    public void processFile(Arguments args) {
        String localName = null;
        String processedName = null;
        try {
            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());
            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);
            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);
        } finally {
            if (localName != null) { // File was downloaded.
                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);
            }
            if (processedName != null) { // File was processed.
                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
If different activities need different options, like timeouts or a task list, multiple client-side stubs can be created
with different options.

    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
        ActivityOptions options1 = new ActivityOptions.Builder()
                 .setTaskList("taskList1")
                 .build();
        this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);

        ActivityOptions options2 = new ActivityOptions.Builder()
                 .setTaskList("taskList2")
                 .build();
        this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);
    }

### Calling Activities Asynchronously

Sometimes workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.
The `Workflow.async` static method allows you to invoke any activity asynchronously. The call returns a `Promise` result immediately.
`Promise` is similar to both Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`. The `Promise` `get` blocks until a result is available.
It also exposes the `thenApply` and `handle` methods. See the `Promise` JavaDoc for technical details about differences with `Future`.

To convert a synchronous call
```java
String localName = activities.download(surceBucket, sourceFile);
```
to asynchronous style, the method reference is passed to `Workflow.async` followed by activity arguments:
```java
Promise<String> localNamePromise = Workflow.async(activities::download, surceBucket, sourceFile);
```
Then to wait synchronously for the result:
```java
String localName = localNamePromise.get();
```
Here is the above example rewritten to call download and upload in parallel on multiple files:
```java
public void processFile(Arguments args) {
    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();
    List<String> processedNames = null;
    try {
        // Download all files in parallel.
        for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {
            Promise<String> localName = Workflow.async(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);
            localNamePromises.add(localName);
        }
        // allOf converts a list of promises to a single promise that contains a list of each promise value.
        Promise<List<String>> localNamesPromise = Promise.allOf(localNamePromises);

        // All code until the next line wasn't blocking.
        // The promise get is a blocking call.
        List<String> localNames = localNamesPromise.get();
        processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);

        // Upload all results in parallel.
        List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String processedName : processedNames) {
            Promise<Void> uploaded = Workflow.async(activities::upload, args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);
            uploadedList.add(uploaded);
        }
        // Wait for all uploads to complete.
        Promise<?> allUploaded = Promise.allOf(uploadedList);
        allUploaded.get(); // blocks until all promises are ready.
    } finally {
        for (Promise<Sting> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {
            // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.
            if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());
            }
        }
        if (processedNames != null) {
            for (String processedName : processedNames) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Child Workflows
Besides activities, a workflow can also orchestrate other workflows.

`Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub` returns a client-side stub that implements a child workflow interface.
 It takes a child workflow type and optional child workflow options as arguments. Workflow options may be needed to override
 the timeouts and task list if they differ from the ones defined in the @WorkflowMethod annotation or parent workflow.

 The first call to the child workflow stub must always be to a method annotated with @WorkflowMethod. Similarly to activities, a call
 can be synchronous or asynchronous using `Workflow.async`. The synchronous call blocks until a child workflow completes. The asynchronous call
 returns a `Promise` that can be used to wait for the completion. After an async call returns the stub, it can be used to send signals to the child
 by calling methods annotated with `@SignalMethod`. Querying a child workflow by calling methods annotated with @QueryMethod
 from within workflow code is not supported. However, queries can be done from activities
 using the `WorkflowClient` provided stub.
 ```java
public interface GreetingChild {
    @WorkflowMethod
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);
}

public static class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

    @Override
    public String getGreeting(String name) {
        GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);

        // This is a blocking call that returns only after child has completed.
        return child.composeGreeting("Hello", name );
    }
}
```
Running two children in parallel:
```java
public static class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

    @Override
    public String getGreeting(String name) {

        // Workflows are stateful, so a new stub must be created for each new child.
        GreetingChild child1 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
        Promise<String> greeting1 = Workflow.async(child1::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);

        // Both children will run concurrently.
        GreetingChild child2 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
        Promise<String> greeting2 = Workflow.async(child2::composeGreeting, "Bye", name);

        // Do something else here.
        ...
        return "First: " + greeting1.get() + ", second=" + greeting2.get();
    }
}
```
To send signal to a child, call a method annotated with @SignalMethod:
```java
public interface GreetingChild {
    @WorkflowMethod
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);

    @SignalMethod
    void updateName(String name);
}

public static class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

    @Override
    public String getGreeting(String name) {
        GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
        Promise<String> greeting = Workflow.async(child::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);
        child.updateName("Cadence");
        return greeting.get();
    }
}
```
Calling methods annotated with @QueryMethod is not allowed from within a workflow code.

### Workflow Implementation Constraints

Cadence uses [event sourcing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) to recover
the state of a workflow object including its threads and local variable values.
In essence, every time a workflow state has to be restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning. When replaying, side
effects (such as activity invocations) are ignored because they are already recorded in the workflow event history.
When writing workflow logic, the replay is not visible, so the code should be written as it executes only once.
This design puts the following constraints on the workflow implementation:
- Do not use any mutable global variables because multiple instances of workflows are executed in parallel.
- Do not call any non deterministic functions like non seeded random or UUID.randomUUID() directly form the workflow code.
Always do this in activities.
- Don’t perform any IO or service calls as they are not usually deterministic. Use activities for this.
- Only use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` to get the current time inside a workflow.
- Do not use native Java `Thread` or any other multi-threaded classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Use `Async.invoke`
to execute code asynchronously.
- Don't use any synchronization, locks, and other standard Java blocking concurrency-related classes besides those provided
by the Workflow class. There is no need in explicit synchronization because multi-threaded code inside a workflow is
executed one thread at a time and under a global lock.
  - Call `WorkflowThread.sleep` instead of `Thread.sleep`.
  - Use `Promise` and `CompletablePromise` instead of `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.
  - Use `WorkflowQueue` instead of `BlockingQueue`.
- Don't change workflow code when there are open workflows. The ability to do updates through visioning is TBD.
- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a workflow execution path.
Pass it as an argument to a workflow function or use an activity to load it.

Workflow method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided
[DataConverter](src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/converter/DataConverter.java) interface. The default implementation uses
JSON serializer, but any alternative serialization mechanism is pluggable.

The values passed to workflows through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.
The entire execution history is transferred from the Cadence service to workflow workers with every event that the workflow logic needs to process.
A large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your workflow.
Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer via activity invocation parameters or return values.
Other than that, no additional limitations exist on activity implementations.
